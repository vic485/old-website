## Keeping at the game

Started this week off working on a basic remap UI. It changes the key setting for the respective control when the button is clicked, and a key is pressed afterwards. The character controller had to be adjusted as well to block input to the controller while in the menu (not shown in the gif below, this will most likely be reused for other UI functions such as in dialogue.)

Moving back into the actual game itself, I began work on a system for interacting with things in the world. A trigger box is moved in the direction the player is walking (based on what direction the idle animation will be in,) and is used to check for interactable object collisions. This is to make sure that the player can only interact with things they are actually facing. The current setup works by having objects, such as chests and signs, derive from an interactable base class, and override the `InteractWith()` function.

That's all so far. I'm starting to feel the stress from the end of the semester at University which takes away from my dev time. Can't wait for it to end so I can jump back in basically full time on this.
