## Case fan and optical drive
Been a little while since I wrote about this, but I wanted to get more done on it before posting updates, and paint takes a while to dry. I managed to get two things done on the computer for this update, the first being a case fan at the back that mounts over the IO panel. I mounted a Noctua NF-A9 PWM fan using the original rear fan mounting shroud. The Noctua fan is a bit thicker than the original fan, so I had to trim down the plastic with a snap off blade (watch your fingers!) to get it to clip in. The fan is mounted as an intake fan and has the old wire cover over it, though I will probably remove it as the clips barely hold in and it doesn't serve a big purpose.

The second bit of progress is with the optical drive. I bought a Pioneer Blu-ray writer for the build, which is thankfully a little shorter than the old DVD drive so I have a bit more working space between it and the PSU. Of course it would break immersion leaving the black bezel of the drive in a beige PC, so I also got a can of beige colored plastic paint. We've been having some strange windy/cold weather so it took a while to actually finish painting it and let it dry completely. The color isn't a perfect match, but for just a rattle-can job I think it is passable.
