## Starting a Touhou Fan Game

This will help serve as the first post on my site, plus I want to keep a log of what I do... even if no one else reads it lol. Anyways I had an idea to make a touhou fan game styled after "Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past." Not very sure on a storyline or anything yet just trying to get the basis down. I'll try to keep at least a bi-weekly log of what I get done in between University studies.
