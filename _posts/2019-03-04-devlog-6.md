## Trying to come back
Okay, so this really kind of fell of the radar. Had some issues trying to get an artist for the game, and then lost time from a trip to Tokyo in January, and issues with my university made it really hard to push myself back into working on the game. I'll try to go over everything that has happened with the project up to now since the last devlog.

Firstly, I decided to remove the character switching mechanic as I couldn't find a way to really make use of this mechanic while keeping with the touhou style. I'm bringing it back to just playing as Reimu through the game, and will probably have Marisa around at certain times to help in puzzles. Secondly, I moved the game out of a private repo on GitHub to a public one with certain parts untracked (like the testing sprites). Also worth noting that in my "ultimate wisdom" I'm starting from the ground up in this repo mostly because I got lost in my code after so much time had passed.

Now for some changes to the game. Most of the things I had before are back in so there isn't much lost time. I decided to work more with the camera system, and coded a way to keep the viewport locked to a "room" that the player is in, much like the way the camera works in "A Link to the Past." It still needs a way to change and lerp between rooms so once I get some time to add to the test level I'll get that in. I also began working with a custom input system to allow key rebindings, and controller vibration. It's still very early so not everything is complete.
