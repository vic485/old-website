## Building a new PC - Sleeper build
### I became really inspired recently to build a sleeper pc (putting modern components into an older pc/case) so here I go documenting my build.
***
The case selection took some time, originally I wanted to build in an SGI O2 since the modular sled system would be interesting to work with, and there was no lack of space, however I couldn't find one for a price that wouldn't kill my budget and I can't take apart the one I already own. My next idea was to use the first generation IBM PS/1 computer I have since the 286 processor prevents it from getting any major use. Unfortunately space is pretty limited in this and I'd have to cut apart the floor of the main section of it to join with the bottom 5.25" floppy drive module inorder to fit most parts. I wanted to have an optical drive in this build as well and couldn't find a way to fit everything.

Finally, after browsing the vintage computing section of ebay for a few days looking at various cheap computers, I settled on a beige Dell Dimension 4100 tower pc. I like the design of the front face of the PC, and looks to have enough space inside depending on the parts chosen. The pc was quite dusty when it arrived as expected, so it'll need a good blowing out and wiping clean once it is torn down. Too cold currently to take it outside and hit it with the air compressor, so I'll take a break on this part here. Pictures below show the computer in all it's beige glory. (A link to the next part will be at the bottom of each page in the future)
