## Gensokyo Quest?

So I missed a week, but everything is ramping up at University for final exams. I don't think I'll get much time to work this week since I have exams at the end, we'll see what the weekend brings. Now, on too the actual devlog.

I started doing a basic rewrite of parts of the game to introduce a character switching mechanic that I wanted to implement. I'm going to try to create puzzles later that utilize taking control of both characters to solve. Also to keep with the top-down style of the game, I worked on having pseudo-depth between the characters. Unfortunately I wasted a bit of time coding a system to do this before being made aware that Unity has the ability to use the Y-axis for sorting.

Small note, I have decided to give this project a working tile of "Gensokyo Quest" which is kind of a play on "Nene-quest" from New Game! This comes from me deciding to post the game's code on GitHub, since my Unity Plus subscription ends soon and I'm not sure how this will affect my use of Unity Teams.
