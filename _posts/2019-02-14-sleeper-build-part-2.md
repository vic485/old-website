## PSU mounting

I recieved the PSU in the mail on Monday, and finally got time to put it in the case. Wanted to fit this first to do a space check for putting in an optical drive since they're both at the top of the case. Had to take a hammer and screwdriver to the case in order to bend back a backing tab from the original power supply which was shorter than this one. The two screw holes in the back fit perfectly with the new power supply (Im beginning to think that Dell actually made an AT compatible pc for once lol), and the controls on the back just manage to fit. Everything fits fine so far, next will most likely come fitting the motherboard and re-installing the standoffs for it.
