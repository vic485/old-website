## Cleaning out the case

Got a warm enough day today, so I decided to jump on the tear down while I was able to stand outside and clearout the probably 20 years of dust in this thing. Took it out back and hit it with an air compressor for a while which got pretty much everything out of it. Forgot to take off the right side panel, so had to deal with a bit of dust there later in the tear down. Most of the parts had a pretty standard removal process. Managed to get a 3Com modem and Sound Blaster Live! from this, which I will most likely use to replace the connexant soundcard/modem in my current Win 98 gaming pc. The motherboard had an interesting mounting style with a lot of small cresent looking pins which clipped into the back of the case. They are movable, so hopefully I can reuse these if the holes in the case are ATX compatible. The board is mainly held in by a bracket that holds the bottom left two mounting holes, and gets screwed in through the back of the case. This took me a while to figure out as I initially tried removing the rubber bumpers under the board and slipping it over the large cresents in the bracket.

So now I've gotten it completely torn down, cleaned out, and washed. Have to start making measurements for parts to figure out what all I can fit in. Ordered a new Supernova G3 750W power supply which I will put in once it arrives to check spacing with an optical drive. Going to figure out some non-invasive modifications for the front panel as well to add USB and audio ports at least.
